Getting started
###################################

The fastest way to get started, after :ref:`installation <installation>`, is to :ref:`walk through a simple demo! <Quickstart guide>`

A more complete introduction for new users, the :ref:`Introductory User Guide <User Guide>`
section is intended for those who want to use their own designs using pre-defined build flows.

:ref:`Reference Manual <References>` section contains useful lookup information,
like flow building blocks, the schema and other API references.

:ref:`Advanced Guide <Advanced Guide>` is intended for users who are already familiar with the basics in User Guide and would like to build their own flows or add additional functionality.
